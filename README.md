# datavis-airpollution-frontend

## Run

To run you just need to launch any kind of webserver in the root of the project. We're using `/index.html`, using resources from `/dist`. If you have php installed (installed by default on Mac) you can run `php -S 0.0.0.0:8080` as a quick test server.

## Develop

To develop you need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/). When you have that installed you can run `npm install` to load all dev dependencies and then run `npm run dev` to open a local server and start developing. Changes in `/src` will be updated automatically.
